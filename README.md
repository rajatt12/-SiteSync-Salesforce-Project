# CRM-Based Communication & Workflow Management System for Construction Projects

## 🏗️ Overview

This project implements a CRM-based system tailored for the construction industry. It aims to streamline and centralize project communications, task assignments, document management, vendor/contractor performance tracking, and real-time project updates to clients.  

This system helps construction firms, project managers, contractors, vendors, and clients stay synchronized — reducing miscommunications, improving transparency, and increasing project delivery efficiency.

## 📄 Problem Statement & Motivation

- Construction projects typically involve many stakeholders: clients, contractors, subcontractors, vendors, vendors’ vendors, site managers, etc. Communication and documentation often get fragmented across emails, spreadsheets, messaging apps, and paper-based records.  
- This fragmentation leads to delays, miscommunication, lost documents, unclear accountability, and poor visibility for clients.  
- There was a need for a unified system to manage all communications, workflows, documents, and performance metrics — accessible to all relevant parties, with real-time updates and audit trails.  
- This motivated the creation of this CRM-based solution on the Salesforce platform (or your chosen CRM backbone), customized for construction-project workflows.

## ✅ Features

- User authentication & role-based access control (e.g. project manager, client, contractor, vendor, admin)  
- Project creation & management (projects, sub-projects, phases)  
- Communication logging — internal messages, notes, emails, discussions tied to projects  
- Task management & assignment — create, assign, update, and track tasks with deadlines  
- Document upload and management — blueprints, contracts, invoices, approval forms, progress photos, compliance documents, etc.  
- Vendor/contractor performance tracking — vendor profiles, past performance records, KPI tracking (e.g. on-time delivery, quality, compliance)  
- Real-time project status updates & dashboards — overall progress, pending tasks, upcoming milestones, vendor performance metrics  
- Client-facing portal or view (optional) — clients can login to view project status, documents, communications, and updates  
- Notification & alert system — when tasks are assigned / due / updated; when new communications or documents are added  
- Audit trail & history logging — track who changed what, when; useful for accountability and record-keeping
